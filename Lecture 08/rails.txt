Ruby on Rails
Rails is used for database-backed web applications.

Most of the code is boilerplate (which a framework handles).

4 parts to a Rails application:
-Models
--CRUD
--Validation
--Assocations
-Routes
--"for this URL, do this thing"
-Controllers
--1) Tell the models to CRUD some data
--2) Tell Rails what to show the user
-Views
--Displayed to the user
