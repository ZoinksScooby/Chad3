Ex: Create a new Rails app with two dummy
controller actions

Install devise

One controller action is visible when logged out, other action is only visible when logged in

add a field called 'age' and 'birthday' to User model
-birthday may be attr_accessible, but not age

make it so that when a new User is created, a birthday is supplied, and then the age in years is automatically inserted

validates_presence_of :age, :birthday

Add Lockout functionality to devise so that a user is locked out after three bad password attempts (Devise::Models::Lockable)
