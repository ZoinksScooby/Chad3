make a Car class

attributes/data:
is it moving? (readonly)
speed (readonly)
make (readonly)
year (readonly)
model (readonly)

methods/actions (public):
press the accelerator (provide speed, how long you moved at that speed)

stuff only the car can do with itself:
move(goes certain speed)

SUB-BONUS: provide odometer functionality, starting the car at a pre-set
"miles traveled" value, and starting/stopping it a few times and having the
odometer increment, naturally.

SUPER-BONUS: car is able to turn left and right by 90 degrees. it starts
at the point 0,0 on an x-y grid. I should be able to know at any given point
what direction it is pointing.
