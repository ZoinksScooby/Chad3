Ex: Parse a very interesting time using Chronic, as weird as you can get. Display it to the screen.

Ex: Use Bit.ly gem to shorten a URL relating to you. Then, use the "code" part of the url (e.g. "30403" in bit.ly/30403) to return all available information about the short URL.

(You will need to get a bitly API key; should be free.)

Ex: Restaurants!

3 classes:
Restaurant
ItalianRestaurant
ChineseRestaurant

For ALL THREE:
create at least one of each
say hello in a meaningful language
Ask each of your restaurants if they have bread (true/false)
Ask each of your restaurants if they have noodles (true/false)
