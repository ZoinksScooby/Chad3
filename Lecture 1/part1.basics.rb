# Part 1: Interpretation / Runtime

puts "This is a program"
puts "Programs are interpreted at runtime."
puts "Which means even though I wrote this on Tuesday, Jan 17th, at 8:36am,"
puts "the time now is "+ Time.now.to_s


puts "Programs have flow."
puts "Which means that you see this first"
puts "and this next."

puts "Lines of code are executed linearly, that's flow. First come, first served."

puts "Programs are composed of basically two things:"

puts "A language's keywords, like 'if' or 'end' (42 in total)"
puts "and then variables and data like this very sentence (or String)."

puts "Anything that isn't one of those will cause an error."
